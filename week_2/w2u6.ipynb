    "## Standard sequence types: `list`, `tuple`, `range`\n",
    "You already learned about two of the three basic sequence types built into Python: `list` & `range`. All sequence types\n",
    "share some properties:\n",
    "- They consist of multiple items which are ordered. (That does not mean they are sorted e.g. by size! It simply means, there is a first item, a second item, etc.)\n",
    "- To access a specific item of the sequence, an index can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another commonly used sequence type called `tuple`. It will be discussed further in the next week.\n",

    "## Text sequence type: `string`\n",
    "\n",
    "You already know strings, too. A string also is a sequence data type. It is used exclusively for text and can contain\n",
    "any unicode character. There are more sequence data types in Python, which will not be discussed in this course, but you\n",
    "can read about them in the\n",

    "table is an excerpt taken from the\n",
    "[Python documentation on common operations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#common-sequence-operations).\n",
    "It shows some of the possible operations common for the sequence types (Note, in the table\n",
